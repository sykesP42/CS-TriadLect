rem Why this file exists: the game prints Chinese to the console (level results,
rem content/ reload messages, error hints). Double-clicking the exe directly gets
rem you a console in the system codepage -- 936 on Chinese Windows -- which turns
rem that UTF-8 text into mojibake. The chcp line below switches the console to
rem UTF-8 so it matches.
rem
rem KEEP THIS FILE ASCII-ONLY. cmd.exe reads .bat files in the OEM codepage, so
rem non-ASCII bytes (even inside rem comments) get mis-decoded and split lines
rem into garbage commands. build.bat is ASCII for exactly the same reason.
